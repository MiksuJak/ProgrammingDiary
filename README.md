# What is it all about?
Hello there!:wave: So nice of You to come around!  
This repository is primarly aimed, to serve as a **personal programming diary** (as it is named) and a **resume** for potential future employers. It will containt of some projects associated with fields of my studies or my interests.    

You would find there **data science** projects containing:  
* :orange_circle: **Jupyter Notebook** analysis  
* :yellow_circle::large_blue_circle: some **Python** files  
* :blue_square: Occasionaly some **R** files  

And also some **frontend** projects hopefully adding some **crypto** flavour with:
* :yellow_square::black_circle: **Java Script**
* :black_large_square::purple_circle: **Solidity**
